      \ how to begin building on it. There's also a <a href=\"https://anvil.works\"\
      >full guide here</a>, if you'd rather view this information outside of the Anvil\
      \ editor.</p>\n  <br>\n  <hr>\n  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n  <p>To use this template\
      \ you will need the following:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/register\"\
      >Stripe account</a></li>\n    <li>An Anvil <a href = \"https://anvil.works/pricing\"\

      >Feedback form tutorial</a>)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <br>\n  <hr>\n  <h2>Configuring\
      \ Stripe and its integration with this app</h2>\n  <p>This template app uses\
      \ Stripe to handle all payment processing and subscription management. Before\
      \ you can begin using this template, you will need to first complete the following\
      \ steps:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li><a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/register\"\
      >Register for a Stripe account</a> and login</li>\n    <li>Enter your <a href=\"\
      https://support.stripe.com/questions/business-information-requirements-to-use-stripe?locale=en-GB\"\
      >business details</a> to start capturing recurring revenue</li>\n    <li>Activate\
      \ Stripe's <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode?locale=en-GB\">test mode</a></li>\n\
      \    <li>Copy your <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/keys\">Stripe account's\
      \ Secret key</a> and, in this app's <a href=\"https://anvil.works/docs/security/encrypting-secret-data\"\
      >Secrets service</a>, set the value of stripe_test_api_key to your key </li>\n\
      \    <li>In the Anvil app editor, publish this app and take a copy of the URL\
      \ - we'll use this in step 6</li>\n    <li>In the Stripe dashboard, <a href=\"\
      https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables\">go to the Products tab and\
      \ then select Pricing tables</a>. Then create a <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/pricing-table\"\
      >pricing table</a>.</li>\n      <ol type=\"a\">\n        <li>In the payment\
      \ settings for each product you will find a \"Confirmation page\" section. In\
      \ that section select \"Don't show confirmation page\" and enter the URL of\
      \ this app that we copied in step 5.</li>\n      </ol>\n    <li>Open the StripePricing\
      \ form in the Anvil editor and <a href=\"https://anvil.works/docs/client/themes-and-styling/html-forms#editing-custom-html\"\
      >edit the custom HTML</a></li>\n      <ol type=\"a\">\n        <li>Back in your\
      \ Stripe dashboard - Copy the \"pricing-table-id\" and paste it into the corresponding\
      \ attribute in the StripePricing form's custom HTML</li>\n        <li>Do the\
      \ same with the \"publishable-key\"</li>\n      </ol>\n    <li>Next, setup a\
      \ <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/no-code/customer-portal?locale=en-GB\">customer\
      \ portal</a> in Stripe and copy the link. Then in this app's AccountManagement\
      \ -> AccountSettings -> SubscriptionPanel, update line 15 to point the \"update_subscription\"\
      \ component's URL to your Stripe's customer portal URL</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Now\
      \ your Stripe integration is complete, it is time to try out this app.</p>\n\
      \  <br>\n  <hr>\n  <h2>Testing this app</h2>\n  <p>Start by setting Login form\
      \ the to be the <a href=\"https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/forms#the-startup-form-or-module\"\

      >run the app</a> and follow along with the in-app instruction notifications.</p>\n\
      \  <br>\n  <hr>\n  <h2>Making this app your own</h2>\n  <p>Now your integration\
      \ with Stripe is setup and you've seen what its's like to be a user of the app,\
      \ it's time to make this app your own.</p>\n  <p>Let's start by removing all\
